This is a fullstack (MERN stack) todo app. Created with `express`, `node` and `mongo` as the backend and `react` as the frontend

> Make sure to install the packages and run the server

```bash
cd server
npm install
npm start
```

> That will run `nodemon index`

Also make sure to start the react app

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm start
```
